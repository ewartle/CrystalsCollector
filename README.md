In this project, I developed a Crystals Collector game for my coding bootcamp class at Georgia Tech.

Upon opening, a random number is generated.  There are four crystals which correspond with distinct random numbers.  Each time the crystal is pushed, that random number is added to the total score.  

The goal of the game is to match the total score to the random number generated.  If the number matches, the user win and the game is reset.  If the number does not match, the user loses and the game is reset.

Thank you for playing this game!
