In this project, I developed a Crystals Collector game for my coding bootcamp class at Georgia Tech.  This is the second project that I have coded using JQuery, javascript, html and css.  

To play, open the site.  Upon opening, a random number is generated.  There are four crystals which correspond with other distinct random numbers.  Each time the crystal is pushed, the random number distinct to the crystal pushed is added to the user's total score.  

The goal of the game is to match the user's total score to the random number generated at the start of the game.  If the number matches, the user wins and the game is reset.  If the user's total score does not match, the user loses and the game is reset.

Thank you for playing this game and enjoy!
