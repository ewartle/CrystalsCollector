		//and this will increase the score by that same amount.

		//total score is initialized to 0
		//the score will continue to increase until it is equal to or exceeds the random number.

		//create a win box
		//initialized at 0
	//the player losses if the score goes above the random number.
		//create a loss box
		//set to 0

	//the game restarts once the player wins or loses and a new number appears

		//at restart -- all the crystal's will have new numbers and values
		//score and counter will reset to 0
		//but the number of wins and loses will remain
